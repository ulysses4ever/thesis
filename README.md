Approx. structure

1. Intro
    - just enough to explain type stability

    - don't need to justify existence of Julia (skip that part of the paper)

    - should lead to a number of questions that you're going to answer:
        - how widely is it used?
        - is it correct?
        - ...

    - 4-5 pages

2. Related Work

3. Thesis Statement
   
    > Type Stability
    > is a widely used program property that can be leveraged by a compiler to generate
    > correct and efficient code
    > and can be approximated by automated techniques

    + maybe limitations

4. Plans of Work

    - Here we say
      - what HAS been done
      - what remains to be done

    - timeline
