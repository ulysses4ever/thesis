                  reclamation overhead to be partially shifted to compile
                  time. The paper assumes a transaction oriented collection
                  scheme, as proposed by Deutsch and Bobrow, the necessary
                  features of which are summarised. Implementing the described
                  optimisations requires global flow analysis to be performed
                  on the source program. It is shown that at compile time
                  certain program actions that affect the reference counts of
                  cells can be deduced. This information is then used to find
                  actions that cancel when the code is executed and those that
                  can be grouped to achieve improved efficiency.},

	Abstract = {The choice of binding time disciplines has major
                  consequences for both the run-time efficiency of programs
                  and the convenience of the language expressing
                  algorithms. Late storage binding time, dynamic allocation,
                  provides the flexibility necessary to implement the complex
                  data structures common in today's object oriented style of
                  programming. This paper shows that compile-time lifetime
                  analysis can be applied to programs written in languages
                  with static type systems and dynamically allocated objects,
                  to provide earlier storage binding time for objects, while
                  maintaining all the advantages of dynamic allocation.},

@article{1998:tse:denicola,
	Abstract = {We investigate the issue of designing a kernel
                 programming language for mobile computing and describe
                 KLAIM, a language that supports a programming paradigm
                 where processes, like data, can be moved from one
                 computing environment to another. The language consists
                 of a core Linda with multiple tuple spaces and of a set
                 of operators for building processes. KLAIM naturally
                 supports programming with explicit localities.
                 Localities are first-class data (they can be
                 manipulated like any other data), but the language
                 provides coordination mechanisms to control the
                 interaction protocols among located processes. The
                 formal operational semantics is useful for discussing
                 the design of the language and provides guidelines for
                 implementations. KLAIM is equipped with a type system
                 that statically checks access rights violations of
                 mobile agents. Types are used to describe the
                 intentions (read, write, execute, etc.) of processes in
                 relation to the various localities. The type system is
                 used to determine the operations that processes want to
                 perform at each locality, and to check whether they
                 comply with the declared intentions and whether they
                 have the necessary rights to perform the intended
                 operations at the specific localities. Via a series of
                 examples, we show that many mobile code programming
                 paradigms can be naturally implemented in our kernel
                 language. We also present a prototype implementaton of
                 KLAIM in Java.},

                 presenting the model used in our work, we describe an

	Abstract = {A new protection mechanism is described that provides
                 general primitives for protection and authentication.
                 The mechanism is based on the idea of sealing an object

                 with a key. Sealed objects are self-authenticating, and

                 in the absence of an appropriate set of keys, only
                 provide information about the size of their contents.
                 New keys can be freely created at any time, and keys
                 can also be derived from existing keys with operators
                 that include Key-And and Key-Or. This flexibility
                 allows the protection mechanism to implement common
                 protection mechanisms such as capabilities, access
                 control lists, and information flow control. The
                 mechanism is enforced with a synthesis of conventional
                 cryptography, public-key cryptography, and a threshold
                 scheme.},

@article{1993:toplas:herlihy,
	Abstract = {A \emph{concurrent object} is a data structure shared by
                  concurrent processes. Conventional techniques for
                  implementing concurrent objects typically rely on
                  \emph{critical sections}; ensuring that only one process at
                  a time can operate on the object. Nevertheless, critical
                  sections are poorly suited for asynchronous systems: if one
                  process is halted or delayed in a critical section, other,
                  nonfaulty processes will be unable to progress. By contrast,
                  a concurrent object implementation is \emph{lock free} if it
                  always guarantees that some process will complete an
                  operation in a finite number of steps, and it is \emph{wait
                  free} if it guarantees that \emph{each} process will
                  complete an operation in a finite number of steps. This
                  paper proposes a new methodology for constructing lock-free
                  and wait-free implementations of concurrent objects. The
                  object's representation and operations are written as
                  stylized sequential programs, with no explicit
                  synchronization. Each sequential operation is atutomatically
                  transformed into a lock-free or wait-free operation using
                  novel synchronization and memory management
                  algorithms. These algorithms are presented for a multiple
                  instruction/multiple data (MIMD) architecture in which
                  \emph{n} processes communicate by applying atomic
                  \emph{read, write, load_linked} and \emph{store_conditional}
                  operations to a shared memory.},

@article{oai:arXiv.org:cs/0303011,
	Abstract = {In multiprogrammed systems, synchronization often
                 turns out to be a performance bottleneck and the source
                 of poor fault-tolerance. Wait-free and lock-free
                 algorithms can do without locking mechanisms, and
                 therefore do not suffer from these problems. We present
                 an efficient almost wait-free algorithm for parallel
                 accessible hashtables, which promises more robust
                 performance and reliability than conventional
                 lock-based implementations. Our solution is as
                 efficient as sequential hashtables. It can easily be
                 implemented using C-like languages and requires on
                 average only constant time for insertion, deletion or
                 accessing of elements. Apart from that, our new
                 algorithm allows the hashtables to grow and shrink
                 dynamically when needed. A true problem of lock-free
                 algorithms is that they are hard to design correctly,
                 even when apparently straightforward. Ensuring the
                 correctness of the design at the earliest possible
                 stage is a major challenge in any responsible system
                 development. Our algorithm contains 81 atomic
                 statements. In view of the complexity of the algorithm
                 and its correctness properties, we turned to the
                 interactive theorem prover PVS for mechanical support.
                 We employ standard deductive verification techniques to
                 prove around 200 invariance properties of our almost
                 wait-free algorithm, and describe how this is achieved
                 using the theorem prover PVS.},

	Abstract = {Message-based communication offers the potential
		 benefits of providing stronger specification and
		 cleaner separation between components. Compared with
		 shared-memory interactions, message passing has the
		 potential disadvantages of more expensive data exchange
		 (no direct sharing) and more complicated programming.
		 In this paper we report on the language, verification,
		 and run-time system features that make messages
		 practical as the sole means of communication between
		 processes in the Singularity operating system. We show
		 that using advanced programming language and
		 verification techniques, it is possible to provide and
		 enforce strong system-wide invariants that enable
		 efficient communication and low-overhead software-based
		 process isolation. Furthermore, specifications on
		 communication channels help in detecting programmer
		 mistakes early --- namely at compile-time --- thereby
		 reducing the difficulty of the message-based
		 programming model. The paper describes our
		 communication invariants, the language and verification
		 features that support them, as well as implementation
		 details of the infrastructure. A number of benchmarks
		 show the competitiveness of this approach.},

@inproceedings{coffeestrainer99,
	Abstract = {Usually, programming languages are used according to
                  conventions and rules. Although general rules can be
                  en-forced by lint-like tools, there is a large class
                  of rules that cannot be built into such tools
                  because they result from particular design decisions
                  or the reuse of existing software. This paper
                  presents a system, called CoffeeStrainer, that
                  statically checks programmer-specified constraints
                  on Java programs. Unlike previous approaches, which
                  only support constraints that apply to definitions
                  of types, CoffeeStrainer additionally supports a
                  second class of con-straints which apply to all uses
                  of a type. Both classes of constraints play an
                  important role for object-oriented class libraries
                  and frameworks, which often make assumptions on
                  their correct use.},

	Abstract = {The World Wide Web has evolved from a distributed
                 hypertext system to a platform-independent graphical
                 user interface that integrates many network services.
                 So far, its technology has restricted it mainly to
                 applications for information retrieval. As networks
                 become ubiquitious and more and more users have a
                 permanent connection, there is an increasing demand for
                 other network services, such as real-time data feeds,
                 group communication, and teleconferencing. So far,
                 these services have been provided by various
                 proprietary software systems, which were hard to set up
                 and use, and thus not very successful. Integrating
                 real-time group communication services into the World
                 Wide Web is a natural way to make them more accessible
                 and will take the Web a step further on its way to
                 becoming the universal network application. In this
                 paper, we describe functionalities required for these
                 services and present an implementation based on Sun
                 Microsystem's Java programming language. We focus on
                 the high-level functionalities and abstractions, but
                 also describe an object-oriented programming model for
                 group communication systems.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes an alternative solution by
                 splitting the verification process in two parts: an
                 off-card part, where sufficient verification
                 information is constructed as a verification
                 certificate to be sent together with the bytecode, and
                 an on-card part, where the remaining verification is
                 performed as a check of the code and the certificate,
                 the lightweight verification, which has the advantage
                 of running in a reasonable almost constant space (and
                 almost linear time). We give a formal specification of
                 the two components for a subset of Sun's Java Card
                 Language, sufficiently strong to write non-trivial
                 down-loadable applets. We prove that the technique is
                 tamper-proof by showing it both sound and complete with
                 respect to standard bytecode verification. Finally we
                 argue that our approach is safer than usual bytecode
                 verification because it isolates a non-complex
                 safety-critical component, the bytecode checker.},

	Abstract = {Region Inference is a program analysis which infers
                 lifetimes of values. It is targeted at a runtime model
                 in which the store consists of a stack of regions and
                 memory management predominantly consists of pushing and
                 popping regions, rather than performing garbage
                 collection. Region Inference has previously been
                 specified by a set of inference rules which formalize
                 when regions may be allocated and deallocated. This
                 article presents an algorithm which implements the
                 specification. We prove that the algorithm is sound
                 with respect to the region inference rules and that it
                 always terminates even though the region inference
                 rules permit polymorphic recursion in regions. The
                 algorithm is the result of several years of experiments
                 with region inference algorithms in the ML Kit, a
                 compiler from Standard ML to assembly language. We
                 report on practical experience with the algorithm and
                 give hints on how to implement it.},

	Abstract = {Java's automatic memory management is the main reason
                 that prevents Java from being used in hard real-time
                 environments. We present the garbage collection
                 mechanism that is used by the Jamaica Virtual Machine,
                 an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine
                 Specification. This mechanism differs significantly
                 from existing implementations in the way threads are
                 implemented, root references are found and in the
                 object layout that is used. The implementation provides
                 hard real-time guarantees while it allows unrestricted
                 use of the Java language. Even dynamic allocation of
                 normal garbage-collected Java objects is possible with
                 hard real-time guarantees.},
