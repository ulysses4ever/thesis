\chapter{Graphs for \chapref{sec:empirical}}\label{sec:app}

This appendix contains graphs similar to the ones described in
\ssecref{sssect:graphs} for all 10 packages discussed in \chapref{sec:empirical}.
There are 6 graphs per package: the top two show the relationship between the
method size and stability (left) or groundedness (right); the other four graphs
connect the two type-related properties with control-flow features: the number
of gotos and the number of returns in a method instance.

Note that the bottom four graphs for every package are different from the top
two in that they group method instances, not methods. Therefore,
the bottom four graphs have all data bins either at level $OY=0$ or $1$, because
we always know whether a method instance is stable (grounded) or not.
The change comes from the fact that the control-flow features in question
depend on compiled code and the way it was optimized: e.\;g., an \c{if true} in a
method can be optimized away during compilation.
